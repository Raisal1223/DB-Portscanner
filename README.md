The scripts in this repository enable scanning of either an URL or IP address, and store the open ports found during the scan in a Redis database. These scripts can be run either locally or through a Docker container. If the user tries to scan an IP address that is already stored in the database, the script will ask if they want to overwrite the existing data or use it. If they choose not to do either, typing "No" will exit the application. If there is no data stored in the Redis database for the IP address being scanned, the script will start a new scan and store the results in the database using the IP address as the identifier.
