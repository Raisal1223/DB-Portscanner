The purpose of this repository is to show various ways to scan an URL or an IP address and have cache it's open ports to the Redis database. These scripts can be executed from the local machine and through the Docker container. Once an URL or an IP address is scanned the data will be stored in Redis. In a situation where the user decided to scan the same IP address it will prompt the user if it want to overwrite the existing data or load the information from the existing data. If the user does not want to take any action, typing "No" will exit out of the application. Lastly if there are no data stored in the Redis database, it will start a brand new scanning and store into the database.
