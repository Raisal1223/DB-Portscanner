The script is capable of scanning a host and storing information about the open ports found in the Redis database as an IP address. If a scan of the same host was done before, the script will ask the user whether they want to use the stored data or overwrite it. If the user chooses not to take any action, the script will exit. If there is no stored data, the script will initiate a new scan and store the information in the database under the IP address.
