This script is a Python program that performs port scanning on one or more URLs provided by the user. It uses the Nmap library to scan for open ports on each URL, and saves the results to a Redis database. The program also generates an HTML report for each scanned URL, which includes information on the open ports and services detected, and the date and time of the scan. The user is prompted to choose whether to use existing data from previous scans or overwrite it with new data. The program uses multithreading to speed up the port scanning process.
